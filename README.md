# hashchainDevelopment process & Development Planning of hash chain:

  2019   Hash chain Silicon Valley laboratory established a development team, concept building and began research and development.

2020   Hash chain matrix module has been officially introduced after two technical design iterations.

2020   The module design was completed in October to meet the market demand.

December 2020   The ecological plan is determined.

January 2021   App development is completed and entered the internal test stage.

March 2021   Test complete

April 2021   Global international market is starting.

May 2021   Asia Pacific recruits global nodes.

In June 2021, hash ecological entertainment industry chain came out, and the organic integration of different entertainment forms made the entertainment industry and encryption assets establish an effective and quick application scenario.

September 2021   It provides users with a safe platform, open multiple transaction pairs, and facilitate users to invest in various digital assets.

In 2021, the global user reached 100000,   The global hash chain is online, and hhc/hkc is used as the circulation medium to run through the whole mall ecology.

By the end of 2021, the global user reached 500000,    Hash ecological anonymous social platform is online, and based on social + blockchain ecology, it links global blockchain users, blockchain investors and traditional Internet users, and provides safe and free open social chat scenarios.

In 2022, the global user reached 1million   Online hash payment system, including chain contract transaction, asset transaction on chain, and leverage transaction on chain.

End of 2022   The global user has exceeded 3 million.

End of 2023    The global user has exceeded 5 million, and the daily transaction volume is more than $10 billion.

  ………… Hash chain has been prepared for sufficient time since the Silicon Valley experimental group was established in 2019, only to present the best side for global members.
